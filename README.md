## My Swift Journal <br>
<hr>
Hello, my name is Josh and I really want to learn the swift programming language to make iOS apps and learn another language. I tought setting up an interactive journal to help me put down what i learn and see how i progressed over time would be a cool idea. I made a shell of it so far but eventually i am planning to add a search bar for dates and posts and added suport for videos and images.
